        <h3>What I do?</h3>
        <div class="what-i-do">
          <p>
            I have three years of experience in teaching, both at the secondary
            and tertiary levels. During this time, I've developed strong skills
            in communication, organization, and problem-solving, which have been
            invaluable in my role as an educator. Additionally, I have two years
            of experience as a Mechanical Engineer in a National Government
            Agency. This experience has allowed me to gain a wealth of knowledge
            and expertise in the field of engineering, which I've been able to
            apply to various projects. My time in a government agency has also
            given me an understanding of how large organizations operate, which
            is a skill that can be particularly valuable in certain roles.
            Overall, my combined experience in teaching and engineering has
            given me a unique skill set that I'm excited to bring to my next
            role. I believe that my experience and skills make me a strong
            candidate for many different positions, and I look forward to
            exploring new opportunities that will allow me to continue to grow
            and develop as a professional. Below are some of the projects I have
            worked on, and handled.

              A Water Desalination System utilizes advanced processes to extract
              salt and impurities from seawater, producing freshwater suitable
              for consumption and irrigation. This innovative technology
              addresses water scarcity challenges, offering sustainable
              solutions to provide clean, potable water for communities in arid
              regions, fostering environmental and societal resilience.

            <h4>Sea Weather System</h4>
            <p>
              A Sea Weather Buoy is an oceanic device designed to collect and
              transmit meteorological and oceanographic data from the sea. It
              typically consists of sensors to measure parameters like wave
              height, sea temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed.
              These buoys play a crucial role in monitoring and forecasting
              marine weather conditions, aiding navigation and supporting
              scientific research.
